            <h1>Emily Noto</h1>
            <h2 class="mb-3">üë©üèº‚Äçüè´ Instructional Coach based in Tomball, Texas</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Working with students internationally through English workshops in
              high school and college sparked my passion for education. Coming
              from a small town in Texas, I was mystified on my first trip to
              China by the hustle and bustle of Beijing, the history and
              tradition of Xi‚Äôan, and the friendly and eager students in my
              English workshop. Similarly, the flame of this passion was fanned
              by the sticky summer heat of the Mekong Delta. As I zoomed through
              the heavy traffic of Long Xuyen on a beat up motorbike, I
              reflected on the beauty of the Vietnamese culture and, once again,
              the eagerness of my students to practice their English. I also
              found this eagerness to learn in the hand of a little African boy
              as he pulled me to his kindergarten classroom in Ghana. We crowded
              around the old blackboard and I remember hearing the tink-tink of
              rain on the rusted tin roof as Miss Vida explained the daily
              handwriting lesson. As she taught, tiny hands excitedly scribbled
              on wrinkled paper with broken pencils. This passion for education
              extended to my teaching experience in the United States. Whether
              it was seeing my students come to life as John Proctor and Abigail
              Williams as we read The Crucible, witnessing my students struggle
              to survive as they simulated the Great Depression in a history
              classroom, or simply encouraging a beginning English language
              learner attempt to speak English for the first time, the hunger
              for knowledge has been inspiring as a teacher. Although the
              geographic location, sights, sounds and smells changed, one part
              of my teaching experience proved true for every country: my love
              for helping eager students learn.
